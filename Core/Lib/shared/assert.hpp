/* Assertion and panic handling code. This allows any part of the code to use assertions.
 * What's an assertion? Let's look at an example.
 * Say there's a temperature sensor that should never exceed 90°C.
 * You could write code like
 * 
 *   uint16_t temperature = read_temperature();
 *   SAFETY_ASSERT(temperature <= 90);
 * 
 * If the temperature ever reaches 91°C, it will call `assert_failed`, which runs
 * whatever code the user has for handling failed asserts. This makes it really
 * easy to check if values are out of range, or certain preconditions must always
 * be met.
 * 
 * There's one other important thing to know: there are multiple different levels
 * of asserts, each of which the user can choose what to do if it fails. Here are
 * some of them:
 *  - `AssertLevel::Soft` is for minor state checks. If a soft assert fails, it means
 *    that nothing dangerous has happened, just some minor check failed. This will do
 *    a soft reset of the system, where it shuts off the engine for a few seconds
 *    before resuming as normal.
 *  - `AssertLevel::Safety` is for safety-critical checks. If a safety assert fails
 *    the car goes into a unrecoverable shutdown, and the whole thing will need to
 *    be reset.
 *  */
